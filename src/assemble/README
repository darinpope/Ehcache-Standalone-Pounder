This is a small  app that exercises the characteristics of the enterprise ehcache tiered store .

Run it using this command:
NOTE: Make sure your get a copy of ehcache that supports BigMemory from www.terracotta.org in order to use this pounder
NOTE: Make sure you get a license key and place it in the directory your running from

An example script for running is included:

	run-pounder.sh

  
  Configuration is done through the config.yml file. All settings are mandatory
  
  storeType: OFFHEAP|DISK|ONHEAP
  threadCount: number of execution threads
  entryCount: Total number of entries to load in the load phase and the number of operations to perform in the read/update phase
  offHeapSize: Amount of ram to dedicate to offheap (NOTE: you also have to have at least that number in the -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=4g)
  maxOnHeapCount: Count of onHeap cache tier entries. This only helps if you have a hot set a slowly moving hotset that fits in memory. If you don't set this thing to 1024
  batchCount: How often you print the current status and change the entry size for each thread
  maxValueSize: Max size in bytes of the value portion of the entry (a random number is picked bellow this)
  minValueSize: min size in bytes of the value portion of the entry (a random number is picked above this)
  hotSetPercentage: Percentage of time you hit an entry from the onHeap portion of the cache
  rounds: Number of times your execute entryCount operations matching the above config elements
  updatePercentage: Number of times out of 100 that you update an entry instead of reading


For example
-----

storeType: OFFHEAP
threadCount: 33
entryCount: 1000000
offHeapSize: "1G"
maxOnHeapCount: 5000
batchCount: 50000
maxValueSize: 800
minValueSize: 200
hotSetPercentage: 99
rounds: 40
updatePercentage: 10

!!IMPORTANT!! the offHeapSize in the config file + the heap size on the java commandline + the memory needed by the OS MUST be less than the physical memory on the machine
